`bash -c "$(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sanjit1/WizardMirror/master/scripts/install.sh)"`

## Getting Started

To start your WizardMirror, run `npm start` from the `WizardMirror` directory. Your WizardMirror can run apps under it, for example a time app or a weather app. App settings can be set in `apps.json` (which is duplicated from [appsSample.json](appsSample.json) by the installation script).

# Hardware
Once you have finished installing WizardMirror and configured all the software, you can move on to the hardware: the actual mirror design. 
You will need 
- LCD screen
- 2 way mirror glass/film
- Wooden frame to frame the mirror.
- Cables to get your Raspberry Pi running and connect it to the Screen
- Other tools

What you will need to do:
Open up your LCD Monitor, attatch the mirror film on top of it, frame it, attatch the Raspberry pi and attatch it to the wall. School's starting, so I cant really do much right now, but as soon as winter break starts I'll try to make a build video.

# Positions
